# Node React Portfolio Website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cmr624/react-portfolio-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cmr624/react-portfolio-site)

## Brief
A recreation of my portfolio website (currently written in Node.JS and EJS for templating / rendering) with full MongoDB, Express, React, Node stack. Currently, we're hosted on: [Heroku](https://react-portfolio-site-cm.herokuapp.com/) but I own carlos-michael.com so I just have to change that to the heroku app once I'm ready for launch.
